<p>Every technology innovation studio in outdoor retail companies faces the same problem whether they know it or not: They’re trying to create startups without startup experience on the execution side.</p>

<p>We’re True Summit</p>

<p>True Summit brings startup methodologies and mentality to technology innovation studios of the world’s best outdoor retail companies through consulting and development. We bring entrepreneurial blood, innovative minds, and rapid, efficient validation and go-to-market development strategies to create a true tech startup incubator for each of our clients.</p>

<p>As a retail company, you’re used to hiring agencies for design and development work. That works for websites, and certain applications, but the structure of agencies, their processes and mindset does not produce innovative startups that are agile, yet efficient, fast, and scrappy. As a corporate accelerator, spinning off a handful, to dozens of startups each year, you need to be led and driven by entrepreneurial minds, both in planning and roadmapping, but also in development.</p>

<h3 id="we-help-increase-efficiency-by">We help increase efficiency by:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Helping define the market, the problem, the need, and the solution before any prototype is created and any code is written. If you’ve done your job, you should have this pretty well defined, or at least with some well defined hypothesis. You can expect us to want to hear all about it, and have you pitch it to us. We want to be convinced, and we want to believe in it. And we may try to poke holes in it.</li>
<li>Excellent communication. Communication, along with transparency, honesty, and trust is at the forefront of everything we do. We expect it from you, and we do everything we can to provide that for you. It makes every relationship and every project 100 times stronger. We view our clients as friends, and treat them as such.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="we-help-decrease-development-time-and-costs-by">We help decrease development time and costs by:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Being scrappy. For example, if we’re early on, we won’t hesitate to throw your app on a $7/mo server that takes literally minutes to set up, instead of wasting days on a provisioning a significantly more expensive server, along with automated deploys for when we hit 50,000 customers. We’re not wasting our time or your money on problems that don’t exist.</li>
<li>Being scrappy. For example, if we decide to offer a free 30-day trial, let’s launch without the ability to take payments to hit the market and get feedback sooner. We’ll have 30 days to get billing in.</li>
<li>Being scrappy. MVP’s, V1’s, V2’s, whatever you prefer to call them, need to be functionally pretty solid. And you want them to be able to be built upon, not scrapped, if it continues to grow. But there’s a balance to be had. You don’t want a development environment that’s a mess, but it also doesn’t need to be over-architected for a bunch of theoretical if-this, if-that’s.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="we-create-strong-relationships-with-our-client-by">We create strong relationships with our client by:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Clear and open communication</li>
<li>Treating our clients as equals, true partnerships, and friends</li>
<li>In that vein, we will talk to you like humans, but in conversation and in this website copy. We have no desire to try to hide behind a mysterious facade of tech jargon and sales pitches. We are humans with a passion for creativity, innovation, development and the outdoor space.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the last startup application we developed, we cut the proposed scope in half for launch, cutting costs by the same amount. We got to market sooner, learned what our customers wanted quicker, and made a better product as a result. Had we built the full initially scope, we’d have wasted a lot of time of features our customers didn’t actually want.</p>

<p>Agencies and contractors who were mainly schooled in that environment are used to building to solve a predefined problem, be it a website to share information about a company, or a mobile application to solve a particular known problem. This is great for a certain type of project, but again, it is not suitable for creating a startup that’s constantly iterating, testing, and shifting gears according to real life, never-ending customer feedback.</p>

<p>Look, we won’t waste your time.</p>

<p>This is where we tell you about our weekly newsletter and why you should care.</p>

<p>We read. A LOT. And what we read about is startups, entrepreneurialism, development, business, marketing, and how to make the world a better place through software (or at least try to, right?!).</p>

<p>Each Thursday we send out an email with our favorite articles on those topics and we want to send those articles to YOU. It’s like a best-of list, right in your inbox.</p>

<p>Enter your email address here and we’ll send the first one your way next Thursday.</p>

<p>Mac is a rare (even one-of-a-kind, in my experience) combination of an extremely talented developer who&rsquo;s also reliable and an excellent communicator.  He understood my vision immediately, knew which details were important to ask about, and which to just plow ahead with, and delivered my MVP not only on-budget but a month ahead of schedule.  Not hyperbole: working with him was a huge source of relief that restored my faith in the universe after so many cost and time overruns with other projects.  I&rsquo;m incredibly grateful for his execution and guidance on the early stages of Tidings and look forward to continuing to work with him.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>David Mihm - Founder at Tidings</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mac is simply the best technical resource I have ever worked with.
I hope that I can apply some of the lessons I’ve learned from working with him throughout the rest of my career.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Matthew Lembo - Technical Director at Gambit</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mac is truly invested in the growth of our company and knocks himself out to make sure everything is running smoothly. I can say without hesitation, Mac is the best technology talent I’ve ever worked with, and he’s a world-class communicator, which makes such a difference.</p>

<p>Before you decide though, let’s make sure we’re the right fit for you</p>

<p>It’s true that you might benefit from our experience building countless SaaS apps for entrepreneurs and startups, having gone through acquisitions, failures, and everything in between. But we may not be the right partner for you. We work best with, and provide the most value for a certain type of company, so let’s briefly touch on that.</p>

<p>We’re not for you if you’re:</p>

<ul>
<li>[TKTKTK]</li>
<li>[TKTKTK]</li>
</ul>

<p>When roadmapping and development is done with a startup mindset, with people that have experience in finding that perfect balance of scrappiness and solidity, with ability to scale, you’re setting your startup up for the it’s best chance at success. You need quick, forward momentum, with the ability to quickly adjust and pivot on a dime. You need to think and develop quickly, get to market quickly, learn, iterate, rinse and repeat. Agile, lean. Did I say scrappy?</p>
